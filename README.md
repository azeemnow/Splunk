# Splunk
SplunkSearch.py:-
Reads data from a file named “DataList.txt” which contains a horizontal list of data (i.e. IPs, Domains, etc.) and save them in Splunk friendly format in a new file called “FormatedDataList.txt”. The format of the new file will be: “data” OR “data” OR “data” OR ….
The logical operator of OR could easily be replaced with another operator (i.e. AND) by making the switch in the program.
